Description: The aim of this package is to develop a general regression framework for 
             the analysis of secondary phenotypes collected in multiple group 
             association studies. Our regression framework is built on a conditional 
             model for the secondary outcome given the multiple group status and 
             covariates and its relationship with the population regression of 
             interest of the secondary outcome given covariates. Then, we develop 
             generalized estimating equations to estimate parameters of interest. We 
             use simulations and a large-scale imaging genetic data analysis of the 
             ADNI data to evaluate the effects of the multiple group sampling scheme 
             on genome-wide association study (GWAS) results based on some standard 
             statistical methods, such as linear regression methods, while comparing 
             it with our statistical methods that appropriately adjust for the 
             multiple group sampling scheme.
